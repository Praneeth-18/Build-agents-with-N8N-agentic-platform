# Assignment Guide: Building Three Unique n8n Apps

## Overview
This assignment focuses on utilizing the n8n platform to create three distinct automation apps. Each app will showcase a different integration scenario:

1. **Chat Frontend App for Customer Support**
2. **Backend-Triggered App (e.g., Kafka, Backend Email)**
3. **Human-in-the-Loop App for Escalation to Human Agents**

You are encouraged to leverage n8n’s extensive templates, video tutorials, and community resources to complete this project.

## App Descriptions and Requirements

### a) Chat Frontend App - Customer Support
**Objective**: Develop an app that simulates a customer support system with a chat-based frontend.

**Key Components**:
- **Webhook node**: To handle incoming chat messages.
- **If/Else node**: To route responses based on user queries.
- **AI integration**: Utilize an AI node for auto-generating responses where applicable.
- **Frontend setup**: Integrate with a basic chat interface for user interactions.

**Hints**:
- Explore existing templates for chat applications on [n8n Workflows](https://n8n.io/workflows/).
- Refer to tutorials such as [Creating a Q&A AI Agent with n8n](https://n8n.io/workflows/2095-ask-a-human-for-help-when-the-ai-doesnt-know-the-answer).

### b) Backend-Triggered App (e.g., Kafka, Backend Email)
**Objective**: Build an app that gets triggered by a backend process, such as a Kafka message or an automated email.

**Key Components**:
- **Trigger node**: Use a Kafka trigger node or Email trigger node.
- **Processing logic**: Implement nodes to parse, validate, and act on incoming data.
- **Output node**: Integrate an appropriate response mechanism (e.g., database entry, notification).

**Hints**:
- Check templates on [n8n Workflows](https://n8n.io/workflows/) for backend automations.
- Reference [Step-by-Step: Build an AI Agent for Gmail Automation](https://n8n.io/workflows/) for backend email triggers.

### c) Human-in-the-Loop App
**Objective**: Create an app that escalates a task to a human agent when specific conditions are met.

**Key Components**:
- **AI decision node**: Route cases based on AI confidence scores.
- **Escalation node**: Use a human agent node to notify an agent when a query requires human intervention.
- **Notification/Approval node**: Implement a system for the human agent to accept and respond.

**Hints**:
- Use the template provided in [Ask a Human for Help](https://n8n.io/workflows/2095-ask-a-human-for-help-when-the-ai-doesnt-know-the-answer).
- Utilize nodes such as the ‘Send Email’ or ‘Slack’ for notifications to agents.
